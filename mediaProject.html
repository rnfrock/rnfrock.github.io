		<h3 style="display: inline">When, Where and Why?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">   This was a project completed at the University of Texas for the course Media Creation for the Live Performance taught by Sven Ortel. The project involved working with choreographers from the Theatre and Dance school, a composer from the Butler School of Music, and myself, fulfilling the role as the media designer from my Theatre and Dance course. Each group performed their pieces for the Ears, Eyes and Feet production.</p><br/><br/>
		<h3 style="display: inline">What and How?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">   My portion of the project involved three movements synced with the composer's music. The first movement was created in a program called TouchDesigner paired with Adobe After Effects, the second movement was primarily in TouchDesigner and th efinal movement was created with a program called Processing, which generates images using Java programming. Adobe After Effects helped me to join all of the movements into a cohesive final product. Below is a portion of the final product. Music composed by Jon Fielder. </p>
