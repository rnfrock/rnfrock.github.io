		<h3>When, Where and Why?</h3>
		<p>This project was started the Summer of 2015, and is actually currently still a work in progress. It was created for Keynote, a company where I have been interning since January 2015. The purpose is to create a monitoring tool that will act as a single device to oversee the many locations and products of the company. </p>
		<h3>What and How?</h3>
		<p>For the database backend of the prototype, a WAMP server was used. The front end was done in Notepad++ with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Comunication with the backend involved MySQL and Javascript. We began with mock data but later set up a few agents within the office to pull real data from.</p>
