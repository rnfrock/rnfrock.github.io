		<h3 style="display: inline">When, Where and Why?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">This project began Summer of 2015, and was finished in August. It was created for Keynote, a company where I interned January through August of 2015. The purpose was to create a monitoring tool that would act as a single device to oversee the many locations and products of the company. </p><br/><br/>
		<h3 style="display: inline">What and How?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">For the database backend of the prototype, a WAMP server was used. The front end was done in Notepad++ with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Comunication with the backend involved MySQL and Javascript. We began with mock data but later set up a few agents within the office to pull real data from.</p>
		<p>(Because this was a work project, I unfortunately cannot post all of the source code or provide access to tour the prototype created. Below are some screenshots of some of the pages of the project)</p>
