		<h3 style="display: inline">When, Where and Why?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">This was a project for the Computer Graphics course I am in currently at the University of Texas at Austin. The course is taught by Don Fussell. This was one of the beginning projects to help get us acclimated to OpenGL and its different functions. </p><br/><br/>
		<h3 style="display: inline">What and How?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">I used VirtualBox installed on my Windows computer in order to program in a Linux environment. The main program was written in C and included OpenGL. The user was able to enter the number of recursions they wanted, with a max of 4. There are screenshots below of degrees zero through three. I also created a menu where the user can choose to display the object as a wireframe or turn off the environment lights. </p>
