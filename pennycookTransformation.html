		<h3 style="display: inline">When, Where and Why?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">    This project is currently in progress at the University of Texas at Austin. I was hired by Professor Pennycook in the music school to help market his personal compositions. One of the major components of this project is redesigning his website so that potential conductors, musicians, etc can navigate through his information and work without the frustration of an unorganized website. </p><br/><br/>
		<h3 style="display: inline">What and How?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">    Bruce Pennycook already had his website set up through GoDaddy. I'm using FTP to receive the current files and then switch them out with the ones I edit. Currently, only the homepage and biography page are live, but the other pages will go up as I finish them. I'm only using HTML and CSS to redesign the pages at the moment, in order to get the basic layout. </p>
