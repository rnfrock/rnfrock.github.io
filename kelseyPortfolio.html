		<h3 style="display: inline">When, Where and Why?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">    This project is a work in progress. My friend Kelsey is about to graduate in December and asked if I could make her a portfolio. I'm taking her vision of the portfolio and making it come to life with HTML/CSS. She needs the site in order to showcase her music and writings. </p><br/><br/>
		<h3 style="display: inline">What and How?</h3>
		<p style="display: inline">    I'm getting all of the content from Kelsey. For each page I have created a basic design and then ask her input, making sure I am creating a site she is proud to call her own. HTML/CSS are currently the only languages being used.  </p>
